# practice-landing-page
This is a project to bring together all of the skills I have been learning in HTML, CSS and Flexbox. 
I think I am going to make this landing page as an expose of my beautiful mother and her inspiring endevors. 
This projecdt is a work in grogress. It is the first landing page I have made independently. There are several edits I still intend to make to this project.
